This is achieved through complex algorithms and models that learn patterns and relationships in data, allowing the AI to create novel outputs.\n",

       "---------------\n",
       "\n",
       "This Python code uses the OpenAI library to generate a response to a given prompt using the Chain of Thought prompt pattern. The `chain_of_thought_prompt` function takes an OpenAI API client and a prompt as input and returns a response generated by the model.\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  The code first initializes the OpenAI API client using your API key.\n",
       "2.  It defines a template for the Chain of Thought prompt pattern, which includes intermediate steps and a final answer.\n",
       "3.  The code then uses the OpenAI API to generate the intermediate steps by providing a prompt for each step.\n",
       "4.  After generating the intermediate steps, the code uses the OpenAI API to generate the final answer based on the steps.\n",
       "5.  Finally, the code formats the response using the Chain of Thought template and returns it.\n",
       "\n",
       "You can adjust the number of intermediate steps and the prompt template to suit your specific use case.\n",
       "\n",
       "Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key to run the code.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Note**: The response generated by the model may not always be accurate or coherent. The quality of the response depends on the model, the prompt, and the intermediate steps generated by the model."
