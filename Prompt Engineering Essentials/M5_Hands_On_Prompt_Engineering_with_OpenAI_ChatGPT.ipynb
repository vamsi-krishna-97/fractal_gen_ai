       "### Explanation:\n",
       "1. **API Key**: Replace `'your-api-key-here'` with your actual OpenAI API key.\n",
       "2. **Prompt Generation**: The `generate_chain_of_thought_prompt` function creates a structured prompt that encourages the model to think through the problem step-by-step.\n",
       "3. **API Call**: The `get_answer` function sends the prompt to the OpenAI API and retrieves the model's response.\n",
       "4. **Execution**: The script runs a sample question about the sum of the first 10 natural numbers and prints the answer.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Usage:\n",
       "You can modify the `question` variable in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to test different questions. Adjust the `max_tokens` and `temperature` parameters as needed to control the length and creativity of the responses.\n",
       "\n",
       "Make sure to handle exceptions and errors in a production environment for robustness."
