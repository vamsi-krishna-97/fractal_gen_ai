The review categorizes articles based on data modality—text, image, or structured data—and examines ethical issues and solutions. For text data, 41 articles focus on ethical concerns related to large language models (LLMs), with discussions on non-maleficence, equity, and privacy. In contrast, articles on image and structured data primarily address privacy through synthetic data generation, with limited discussion on autonomy, integrity, or morality. The study emphasizes the need for balanced perspectives that address both ethical challenges and solutions in generative AI."

The battery life is underwhelming, barely lasting a few hours on a full charge. The fan is quite noisy, which is distracting during work. Additionally, the laptop feels bulky and heavy, making it inconvenient for travel. The screen quality is mediocre, with poor color accuracy.

       "The JKL Laptop has been a letdown. The keyboard is uncomfortable, with keys that feel sticky and unresponsive. The touchpad is erratic, often not registering my gestures correctly. The laptop frequently overheats, causing it to shut down unexpectedly. The build quality is subpar, with a flimsy plastic casing that feels cheap. The display is dull, lacking the vibrancy I expected. Customer support was unhelpful when I reached out for assistance. I regret this purchase and would not recommend it to others.\n",

       "I regret buying the MNO Laptop. The initial setup was frustrating, with numerous software updates required before I could even start using it. The performance is inconsistent, with frequent lag and crashes. The speakers are tinny, providing poor audio quality. The webcam is low-resolution, making video calls a challenge. The laptop's design is uninspired, and it feels outdated compared to other models in the same price range. This purchase has been a disappointment, and I am considering returning it.\n",
